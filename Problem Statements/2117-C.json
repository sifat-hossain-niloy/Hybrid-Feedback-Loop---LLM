    "statement": "Yousef has an array\na\nof size\nn\n. He wants to partition the array into one or more contiguous segments such that each element\nai\nbelongs to exactly one segment.\nA partition is called cool if, for every segment\nbj\n, all elements in\nbj\nalso appear in\nbj+1\n(if it exists). That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.\nFor example, if\na=[1,2,2,3,1,5]\n, a cool partition Yousef can make is\nb1=[1,2]\n,\nb2=[2,3,1,5]\n. This is a cool partition because every element in\nb1\n(which are\n1\nand\n2\n) also appears in\nb2\n. In contrast,\nb1=[1,2,2]\n,\nb2=[3,1,5]\nis not a cool partition, since\n2\nappears in\nb1\nbut not in\nb2\n.\nNote that after partitioning the array, you do not change the order of the segments. Also, note that if an element appears several times in some segment\nbj\n, it only needs to appear at least once in\nbj+1\n.\nYour task is to help Yousef by finding the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition.",
