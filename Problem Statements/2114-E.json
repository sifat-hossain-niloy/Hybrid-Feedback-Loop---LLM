    "statement": "Once, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with\nn\nvertices, with the root at vertex\n1\n. Each vertex of the tree has a number\nai\nrecorded, which represents the danger of vertex\ni\n. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\nFor a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximum alternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex\ni\nis defined as\nai−api+appi−…\n, where\npi\nis the parent of vertex\ni\non the path to the root (to vertex\n1\n).\nFor example, in the tree below, vertex\n4\nhas the following vertical paths:\n[4]\nwith an alternating sum of\na4=6\n;\n[4,3]\nwith an alternating sum of\na4−a3=6−2=4\n;\n[4,3,2]\nwith an alternating sum of\na4−a3+a2=6−2+5=9\n;\n[4,3,2,1]\nwith an alternating sum of\na4−a3+a2−a1=6−2+5−4=5\n.\nThe dangers of the vertices are indicated in red.\nHelp Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.",
